I would also probably group birthdays and special events together as well, sadly after doing that, we might as well drop the column. The lack of other reasons leads me to believe that there might have been a problem with the options to choose from or lack of options in general. From the data shown, one could gather the amount people spent were willing to spend on pubs a month and the percentage of their imcome they are willing to spend on this habit. The data seems to be biased towards students around the ages of 18-21, this could also explain the the reasoning all being so similar."
