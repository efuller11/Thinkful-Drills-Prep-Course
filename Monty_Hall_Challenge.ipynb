    "Q: You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?"

    "I got the answer wrong at first, at first glance it made sense to me the probabilty was 50-50 after one door was taken out of the equation. I looked at the wiki explaining it and my understanding now is that your original guess being 1/3 odds did not change at all once you picked it. Another thing that didn't change was other door's chances combined are still 2/3 odds of success. With them doing the favor of removing a door between those two the 2/3 odds shifts from two doors to the single door. Choosing to switching doors will give the better chance at 2/3 odds instead of 1/3 odds."
